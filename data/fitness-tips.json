    "Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep to support recovery.",
    "Include at least one full rest day per week to avoid overtraining.",
    "Hydrate consistently—dehydration affects heart rate variability.",
    "Combine high-intensity sessions with low-intensity recovery workouts.",
    "Prioritize protein intake after resistance training to aid repair.",
    "Maintain a consistent sleep schedule for better sleep architecture.",
    "Use short naps (20-30 minutes) rather than long naps to avoid sleep inertia.",
    "Warm up properly to reduce injury risk and improve performance.",
    "Monitor long-term trends (weeks) rather than single-session metrics.",
    "Balance stress and recovery—mental stress impacts physical recovery."
